# Sentiment-Anlysis-using-Optimal-Transport-loss-function

This repository is a testament to the exciting journey of optimizing sentiment analysis using a loss function based on the Optimal Transport (OT) Plan. 🚀

The Optimal Transport plan, originally introduced by the geometer Gaspar Monge and further refined by the Nobel laureate Leonid Kantorovich, brings us an ingenious way to minimize transport costs and find relevance in density function comparisons. 🌐📉

In the realm of cutting-edge Sentiment Analysis techniques, most efforts have centered around supercharging models and achieving better hyper-parameter tuning. However, in our approach, we dared to take a different path by putting the spotlight on optimizing the loss function itself. 📊🛠️

We elegantly treated the sentiment predictions as living density functions and embarked on a mission to optimize transportation costs, effectively marrying label insights with loss function finesse. This creative approach injected a breath of fresh air into the optimization process. 💨🤖

Our innovative solution was put to the test using a treasure trove of US Airline Comments for Sentiment Analysis.
